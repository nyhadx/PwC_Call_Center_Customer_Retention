## Introduction

This series of projects is part of the PwC Digital Accelerator Program, an initiative aimed at upskilling employees for technologies such as automation, digital literacy, machine learning and design thinking.

Here are the key points the retention manager wants to consider before proceeding:

- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: It has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: Visualized clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management



## Data

The dataset contains the following info:
Customer ID (Unique identifier for each customer), customer's gender, tenure, monthly and total charges, churn info and services each customer is subscribed for.



## Analysis
Key Findings:
1.	Contract - Month-to-Month: Churn rate for month-to-month contract customers is 42.71%, significantly higher than customers on longer-term contracts. These customers might lack incentives to stay with the service.
2.	Tech Tickets – More than One: People who raised 1 or more technical tickets had a churn rate of 69.4%, highest churn rate in this entire study. This indicates strong dissatisfaction with how the issue was handled.
3.	Payment Method - Electronic Check: Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rate at 45.29%. This indicates potential dissatisfaction or friction with this payment method.
4.	Internet Service - Fiber Optic: Fiber optic users show a 41.89% churn rate, suggesting service quality issues or perceived high costs associated with this service type.
5.	Value Added Services - No: Customers without any value added services (average churn rate 40%)  except for streaming services are more likely to leave, indicating that customers who lack additional services may feel less committed.
6.	Senior Citizen Customers: The churn rate among senior citizens is 41.68%, which might point to usability issues or a lack of tailored service options for this demographic.



## Recommendations

Recommendations for Improvement:
1.	Enhance Payment Options: Consider providing incentives for customers to switch from electronic checks and paperless billing to more user-friendly payment methods such as automatic bank transfers or credit cards. Offering discounts or rewards for using these methods could reduce churn.
2.	Promote Long-Term Contracts: Introduce attractive benefits for customers who switch from month-to-month to longer-term contracts, such as discounted rates or additional features. This could help increase retention among customers who may be considering other providers.
3.	Address Fiber Optic Service Concerns: Investigate potential issues with the fiber optic service, such as frequent outages, slow speeds, or perceived high costs. Offering a service review or providing value-added services (e.g., free technical support or equipment upgrades) could improve customer satisfaction.
4.	Encourage Adoption of Value Added Services: Educate customers on the benefits of online security, device protection, tech support, online backup and consider bundling it with other services at a discounted rate. This could increase service stickiness and reduce churn for customers who currently don’t subscribe.
5.	Tailor Services for Senior Citizens: Develop offerings specifically targeted at senior citizens, such as simplified billing, personalized customer service, or training on using digital services. This demographic may benefit from services that cater to their specific needs and preferences.
