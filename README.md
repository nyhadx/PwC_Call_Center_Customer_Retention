## Introduction

This series of projects is part of the PwC Digital Accelerator Program, an initiative aimed at upskilling employees for technologies such as automation, digital literacy, machine learning and design thinking.

Here are the key points the retention manager wants to consider before proceeding:

- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: But it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: Visualized clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management



## Data

The dataset contains the following info:
Customer ID (Unique identifier for each customer), customer's gender, tenure, monthly and total charges, churn info and services each customer is subscribed for.



## Analysis
Key Findings:
1.	Contract - Month-to-Month: Churn rate for month-to-month contract customers is 42.71%, significantly higher than customers on longer-term contracts. These customers need better reasons to stay with the service.
2.	Tech Tickets – More than One: People who raised 1 or more technical tickets had a churn rate of 69.4%, highest churn rate in this entire study. This indicates strong dissatisfaction with how the issue was handled.
3.	Payment Method - Electronic Check: Customers using electronic checks have the highest churn rate at 45.29%. This indicates potential dissatisfaction or it might be a hassle using this payment method.
4.	Internet Service - Fiber Optic: Fiber optic users show a 41.89% churn rate, suggesting service quality issues or high costs associated with this service type.
5.	Value Added Services - No: Customers without any value added services (average churn rate 40%)  except for streaming services are more likely to leave, indicating that customers who lack additional services may feel less committed.
6.	Senior Citizen Customers: The churn rate among senior citizens is 41.68%, which might raise questions about ease of use or a lack of tailored service options for this demographic.



## Recommendations

Recommendations for Improvement:
1.	Easier Payment Methods: We could encourage customers to use automatic payments (like bank transfers or credit cards) instead of paper checks. How about giving them a small discount or reward for switching? This might make them happier and less likely to leave.
2.	Promote Long-Term Contracts: If people are on month-to-month plans, they might leave faster. What if we offered them a deal like a cheaper price or extra features if they sign up for a 1-year contract? That could help retain customers.
3.	Address Fiber Optic Service Problems: A lot of fiber optic users are leaving. We should check if the service is too expensive, has slow speeds, or breaks a lot? If there are issues, maybe offer free tech support or better equipment to make them happier.
4.	Encourage Adoption of Value Added Services: Customers without things like online security or tech support leave more often. Starting a program to educate customers might be useful. Or bundle them together at a lower price so they’re easier to buy.
5.	Tailor Services for Senior Citizens: Seniors are leaving a lot too. We could try making bills simpler to read, giving them a special customer service line, or teaching them how to use the website/app. They might stay if things feel easier for them.
